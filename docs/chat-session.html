Here is the official glossary. Read it. Name the three most interesting terms.</div></pre>[PDF left out]<pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>&gt; After reviewing the iSAQB glossary, here are three interesting terms:

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: This term refers to a common language used by all team members in a software development project, ensuring clarity and consistency in communication. It's particularly relevant in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) where it helps bridge gaps between different domains and technical jargon.

2. **Architectural Pattern**: These are general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software architecture. They provide a template or blueprint for how to structure software systems and are crucial in guiding design decisions and standardizing practices.

3. **Fitness Function**: In the context of software architecture, a fitness function is a quantitative measure used to guide the design and evolution of a system. It evaluates how well the system meets a set of architectural goals, and can be a powerful tool in ensuring that a system maintains its intended quality attributes over time.

These terms reflect important concepts in software architecture, emphasizing communication, design principles, and the continuous evaluation of system quality.</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">user</div><div>I now want to solve the example certification task called "BigSpender" with you.

The rules primarily focus on the requirements for independent work, citation of sources, and identification of AI-generated text. They also outline the consequences of violating examination regulations, such as cheating or plagiarism.

If there is an NDA or similar confidentiality agreement related to the exam, it might be detailed in a different section of the document or in a separate agreement provided by the iSAQB. In such cases, it's important to adhere to the terms of the NDA, which typically includes not disclosing exam content or details to unauthorized parties.</div></pre></div>
