= BigSpender System Architecture - Technical Context

== Subtask 3 â€“ Technical context
Create a technical context for the BigSpender system, identifying all users, devices, and external systems, including those technically motivated and missing in the business context view. Decide which parts to develop in-house and which to buy or use as open source, distinguishing these parts accordingly. Additionally, state the communication mechanism for each connection between technical nodes.

This solution strategy provides a comprehensive overview of the technical context for the BigSpender system. It identifies all actors and external systems that interact with BigSpender, and the communication protocols used. This approach ensures that the technical architecture aligns with the business needs and quality requirements of the system.
