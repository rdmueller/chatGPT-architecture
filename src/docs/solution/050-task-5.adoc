= BigSpender System Architecture - Technology Decisions

== Subtask 5 â€“ Technology decisions
Define the technology stack mapping the BigSpender design onto real IT infrastructure, describing programming languages, operating systems, database technologies, and communication mechanisms. Then, explain and rationalize how this technology stack ensures the quality goals identified in subtask 1, focusing on the user interaction of "Submitting an Expense Claim." This will include a tabular step-by-step presentation of the workflow, showing the contribution of system parts towards achieving the quality goals.

== User Interaction: Submitting an Expense Claim

The interaction chosen to demonstrate the technology stack and its alignment with quality goals is "Submitting an Expense Claim."

=== Technology Stack Overview
- Programming Language: Java with Spring Boot
- Operating System: Linux
- Database Technologies: PostgreSQL and Redis
- Communication Mechanisms: RESTful APIs, HTTPS, and TLS
- Front-End Technologies: React and Bootstrap
- Cloud Infrastructure: AWS
- DevOps Tools: Docker and Jenkins
- Security: Spring Security, OAuth 2.0, JWT
- Monitoring and Logging: ELK Stack
