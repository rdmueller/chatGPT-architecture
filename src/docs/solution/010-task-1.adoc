= BigSpender System Architecture - Quality Requirements

== Subtask 1 â€“ Quality requirements
The objective is to derive quality scenarios from the case study and allocate content-related importance to them.
We create a utility tree showing the connection with the relevant business features.
We then filter out the most important quality goals and give these a weighting.
The expected results are:
- A table with 3-5 quality goals, including the quality feature for each goal, a brief motivation, and the weighting of the goal.
- A formulated quality scenario per quality goal, each with business importance.
- A utility tree as a graphic.

This approach ensures that the most critical aspects of system quality are identified, prioritized, and addressed in the architectural design.
The quality scenarios are formulated to align with the business's needs and are weighted to reflect their relative importance to the company's operations.
