= BigSpender System Architecture - Business Structuring

== Subtask 4 â€“ Business structuring
The objective is to develop and visualize a rough business structuring of the BigSpender system. This involves naming the individual system components, defining their responsibilities, and explaining how they interact. This approach provides a clear and modular view of the system, facilitating understanding and communication among stakeholders.

This business structuring of the BigSpender system provides a comprehensive view of the system components and their roles. The modular approach aligns with the system's quality requirements, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clear delineation of responsibilities. The inclusion of external systems highlights the system's integration points, essential for a holistic understanding of the system architecture.
