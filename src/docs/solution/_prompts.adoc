What is the third sub-task?
Solve the third sub-task as AsciiDoc document.
Repeat the original sub-task description and add some explanation why you've solved the task this way.
Embed the context diagram as plantUML diagram in the AsciiDoc document.
Use the C4 notation for the diagram.
Put labels with the corresponding protocol on all connections.
Add a table which contains all external systems and their respective protocols.

How much context of your context window have we already used up in this session? Answer in terms of tokens.

Let's start to work on the technical context.
First, name all actors who will interact with the system.
Then name all external systems which will have a connection to our system.
Then name all external interfaces which will be used by our system in a table together with the protocol used.
If you have questions about the protocol, just use HTTP.

Now, solve the first task by creating the expected deliverables as one AsciiDoc document:
Expected Deliverables: The task expects the submission of 3-5 quality goals in a table format with a brief motivation for each and their respective weightings, a formulated quality scenario for each quality goal with its business importance, and a utility tree presented graphically.
Repeat the original sub-task description on top of the output and add some explanation why you've solved the task this way.
Include the utility tree as plantUML diagram in the AsciiDoc document via the diagrams plugin.

Solve the second subtask by creating the expected results as one AsciiDoc document.
Repeat the original sub-task description on top of the output and add some explanation why you've solved the task this way.
If you have any questions about this task, ask them now.
